#### Q: How do I use offline synced lyrics?
- STEP 1: Look for a song that doesn't have lyrics.
- STEP 2: Search the web for the lyrics of your desired song (you either have to find a ".lrc" file or lyrics with timestamps for example "[00:04:02] Some lyrics text"). If you find a lyrics file that's great or find lyrics with timestamps you have to create a ".lrc" file. 
- STEP 3: Now you have to rename the file you created in this way: <song_name> - <artist_name>.lrc or for better matching copy the <song_name> and the <artist_name> from the tag editor and then rename the file.
- STEP 4: You have to copy or move the file into a location on the SD Card: whatever_sdcard/RetroMusic/lyrics/ and paste inside your ".lrc" file in there.
